    <h3>This is an easy lasagna recipe that anyone can make!</h3>
    <p>
      There is something so nostalgic about pasta dishes in general, but lasagna
      specifically holds a special place in the hearts of many. For when you're
      looking to switch up your lasagna routine, here is a great alternative to
      the traditional.<br />
      This recipe takes the well-known elements of Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo
      and morphs them into a delicious lasagna.<br />
      Enjoy it as a weeknight meal that comes together in less than an hour, or
      prepare the dish ahead of time and freeze it for baking later. <br />
      Just be sure to assemble the lasagna in a disposable aluminium baking
      dish, cover the assembled lasagna dish tightly with foil, and store inside
      a large freezer bag in the freezer for up to three months. <br />
      Thaw in the fridge when ready to eat and bake according to recipe
      instructions!

    <h3>ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
      <li>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>10 ounces baby spinach</li>
      <li>3 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>3 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded</li>
      <li>4 ounces thinly sliced pancetta, cut into strips, and cooked</li>
      <li>3 ounces prosciutto, or deli ham, cut into strips and cooked</li>
      <li>9 ounces oven-ready lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>3 to 4 basil leaves, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat add butter, garlic, and onion
        and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the spinach and 1 tablespoon of water and stir until it wilts about
        1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add milk, Parmesan, ricotta, and parsley. Salt and pepper to taste and
        stir until incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise heat to high and heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture
        comes to a slight simmer and begins to thicken, about 8 minutes. Remove
        from heat and stir in chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 9 x 13-inch baking dish add a large spoonful of the chicken Alfredo
        mixture. Layer with noodles, Alfredo mixture, sliced pancetta and
        prosciutto, then one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat
        with the remaining ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 35 to 35 minutes. Remove foil
        and broil for 2 to 3 minutes or until cheese is slightly browned and
        bubbling.
      </li>
      <li>Top with fresh basil and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
