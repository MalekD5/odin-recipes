      <h3>Meatloaf is an American institution. In addition to being easy to prepare, EVERYBODY loves it.</h3>
      <p>his classic meatloaf with oatmeal recipe is an easy recipe that is quick to assemble.<br>
            Here, quick-cooking rolled oats are used as a filler to help keep the texture of the meatloaf light and to help retain the moisture of the meatloaf so it doesn't become dry. <br>
            Quick-cooking oats are ideal because they are finer than old-fashioned rolled oats which would add too much texture to the dish. Do not use steel-cut oats in a meatloaf, 
            since they will remain hard and inedible. <br>
            Meatloaf tastes great when served alongside buttery mashed potatoes and your choice of green vegetable such as string beans. <br>
            Any leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer. It is common to transform leftover meatloaf into a delicious meatloaf sandwich the next day.

      <h3>Steps:</h3>
